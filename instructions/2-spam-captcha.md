# Add a captcha to your form

I would not recommend captchas unless all other options have already been exhausted and spam continues to roll in. After all, captchas add some friction for genuine users as well.

In essence, captchas add yet another barrier to the process by requiring users to prove that they're human, often in the form of solving visual riddles (that are hard to execute by bots), although some have implemented additional heuristics to confirm that you're a human without too much friction.

Note that some bots are able to solve certain captcha implementations already, so this too is not necessarily a silver bullet. Nothing will ever be: bots adapt and all that we can do is add more hurdles for them to just over, ideally without too much impact on actual human users.

If you want to pursue implementing captchas in your form, you may want to look into [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/).
